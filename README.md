### What I learned

I recently completed a newbie challenge on FrontendMasters, diving deep into the world of CSS Flexbox. Before this, positioning items in dynamic layouts felt complex. Flexbox, however, transformed my approach, offering a streamlined method to align and distribute elements within a container. Through properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction, I mastered the art of creating responsive and visually appealing designs. This wasn't just about grasping a theoretical concept; it was hands-on learning, giving me the confidence to tackle modern web design challenges with a fresh perspective.

```css

  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}

Using pivotal properties, I now confidently craft responsive designs, a testament to my hands-on growth in modern web design. My continuous development highlights my resilience and adaptabilit
